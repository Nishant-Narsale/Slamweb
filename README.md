# Slamweb

At the time when we were kids, all of us have written at least a single slam in our Slambook.
That was the most exciting thing in schools.

Now We came with a idea not to waste more pages and money on buying Slambooks.

Basically This is a website made in Django for making writing slams to our friend more easy and funny.

Here we will offer functionalities like -
  - Maintainig their data by using authentication system to make website good and personal
  - Writing different slams according to different slams
  - Make use of our own default slams 
  - and many more...
  
The project is under development and list will go on increasing.

If you want to contribut feel free to contribute to our website.
